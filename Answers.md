  Git Hub offers scientists a platform and medium to exchange ideas and code. It also allows for simultaneous editing that each member of a project can access. There is less confusion created and it is easier to collaborate with those that are far away. Also, because commits are followed with an explanation for the change, it allows each scientist to think about their edits and make sure that what they are including is necessary. Also, Git Hub allows scientists to receive any help they may need with their code from those who may be more specialized in programming. Sometimes technical help can be hard to receive or not be specific enough for their problems and so Git Hub allows scientists to collaborate efficiently. The nature of Git Hub also promotes cross validation from multiple people to ensure that their code is correct and their reasoning for it is correct as well. It is easy to think your method is the best, but many times there are faster and more efficient ways to code. Having extra pairs of eyes looking at and editing your code is a huge benefit to provide quick and accurate results.
